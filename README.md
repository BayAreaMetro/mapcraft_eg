[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/BayAreaMetro/basis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/BayAreaMetro/basis)

_DRAFT: This repository is under construction; nothing here should be considered current or correct.

This repository contains land use/urban economics data and related code for Bay Area Metro. The major categories of data and code (equivalent to the directory structure above) are:

* basemap: information on the current state of buildings and their inhabitants
* control totals: region-wide forecasts for households and employment
* deed restricted units: a database of current housing with low income residency requirements
* institutions: a current and forecast database of large entities (e.g., universities, hospitals) and group quarters
* pipeline: a list of building projects recently completed, under construction, or approved
* policies: information on existing local and regional land use policies
* scenarios: changes to policies and assumptions used to build alternate growth sceanrios
* scripts: code to modify or integrate datasets
* tests: code to assure the validity of database changes
* zones: various boundary files and related data for TAZs, MAZs, Jurisdictions, PDAs, etc; geographic lookups

BASIS is the working name for Bay Area Metro's land use and urban economics database. It stands for Bay Area Spatial Information System, the same name used by ABAG in the 1970's for the region's first digital geographic information system.

Questions should be directed to:
* Cynthia Kroll on control totals: ckroll@bayareametro.gov
* Aksel Olsen on existing policies: aolsen@bayareametro.gov
* Kearey Smith on the pipeline: ksmith@bayareametro.gov
* Shimon Isreal on institutions: sisreal@bayareametro.gov
* RPP Team member TBA on scenarios:
* Michael Reilly on the basemap or other topics: mreilly@bayareametro.gov
