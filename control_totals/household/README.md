# Household Control Totals

The household control totals provide regionwide forecast information on household counts and charactersitics in future years. They bring information from the regional models (REMI and demographic model) into UrbanSim. They also provide the only route for moving regional forecast information into the travel model. There are two types of household control totals:

## 1. Unified Household Level Counts



## 2. Regional or Group-Specific Characteristics
