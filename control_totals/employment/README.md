# Employment Control Totals

The employment control totals provide regionwide forecast information on employment counts by sectors in future years. These serve as drivers for the occupying of existing commdercial buildings and the contruction of new commercial buildings in UrbanSim. In the travel model employment counts by location serve as potential ends of commute trips and proxy for certain such accessibility measures susch as amount of retail shopping at a location.

Once an approach and a classification system is chosen for the regional employment forecast, the micro location of jobs will also be coded within this system. Travel Model 2 is currently set up to use the "steelhead" sectoral classification, an ad hoc system with 20-something categories that easily convert into ABAG's various systems. We migh instead choose to classify jobs under the 2-digit NAICS code or the REMI 70 categories.
