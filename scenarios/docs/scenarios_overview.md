# Scenarios Overview




Differences between previous plan model input and No Project 

## The No Project Scenario
The No Project takes its name from CEQA EIR process. In most ways, it is the baseline alternative against which the Proposed Plan and the other scenarios are compared. The No Project represents what we think would happen if there was no policy/project intervention. 
THe most direct way to interpret this is that the policies and projects "in place" now remain in place. So, for the most part, the existing zoning, growth caps, fees, etc control the forecasted land use trajectory. Any known future changes are added during the forecast when they are expected to occur. On the transport side, we keep the existing system and include projects that are under construction or committed. 
In practice, a few other things change to make the No Project our best guess on where we are headed without the Plan. For instance, some Bay Area cities have urban growth boundaries while other do not. The assumption that all existing city limits and urban growth boundaries stay in place seems too hopeful. More likely, some cities will expand, new cities may form, and some urban growth boundaries will be expanded (as they have been in the past). So, the No Project assumes that the expansion of land avaialable for suburban growth continues at the same rate it has over the past three decades.
